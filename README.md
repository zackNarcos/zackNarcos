ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to my Fullstack developer profile! I'm a passionate developer with over two years of experience building innovative software and websites. I have a solid experience in developing front-end and back-end solutions, as well as database integration.

My passion for technology pushed me to pursue a career in software development. Over the past two years, I have worked on a variety of exciting projects, which have allowed me to hone my skills in several programming languages, including Java, php, TypeScript and JavaScript.

I'm particularly proud of my expertise in website development, where I've gained solid experience using frameworks such as Symphony, Angular, and Flask. Moreover, I am able to implement REST APIs in Symphony to allow efficient communication between the different components of my projects.

I am also comfortable using SQL databases, and have worked with tools such as MySQL to store and retrieve data.

As a Fullstack developer, I am able to manage the entire development cycle, from initial design to final delivery. I enjoy working in a team and am used to collaborating with designers and project managers to achieve company goals.

If you are looking for a competent and passionate Fullstack Developer, look no further. Contact me to discuss your next exciting project!
